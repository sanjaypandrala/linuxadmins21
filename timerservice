# chronyd service manages time
# config is in /etc/chrony.conf
# iby default t is using ntp server ntp.pool.org

# server or peers
# server is authoritative. this is better
# peer is not, two peers will try to middle timedatecl
# configuration is in /etc/chrony.config
# server server.rhatcert.com
# peer server1.example.com
# peer server2.example.com
# systemctl restart chronyd
# use chronyc for monitoring
# chronyc sources -v to check current configuration
# chronyc tracking for detailed info
#### ex use timedatectl to set time server1 one hour ahead configure NTP
# synchronization on server1 and server2 to use NTP peers only: both should
# use one another as peers monitoring time synchronization to a time in
#### the middle
#### exexp use timedatecl time-set 16:00 to set timedatecl
# before starting NTP, remove the server lines from /etc/chrony.conf and add
# peer lines for the other server
# use timedatecl set-ntp on to switch on ntp
# monitor synchronization status using chronyc sources -v or chronyc tracking
